# Ember-cli-deploy-cp

> An ember-cli-deploy-plugin to copy your built assets on your filesystem

[![](https://ember-cli-deploy.github.io/ember-cli-deploy-version-badges/plugins/ember-cli-deploy-cp.svg)](http://ember-cli-deploy.github.io/ember-cli-deploy-version-badges/)

This plugin uses [cpr][1] to copy built assets on your filesystem. It basically supports all its options.

## What is an ember-cli-deploy plugin?

A plugin is an addon that can be executed as a part of the ember-cli-deploy pipeline. A plugin will implement one or more of the ember-cli-deploy's pipeline hooks.

For more information on what plugins are and how they work, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][2].

## Quick Start
To get up and running quickly, do the following:

- Ensure [ember-cli-deploy-build][3] is installed and configured.

- Install this plugin

```bash
$ ember install ember-cli-deploy-cp
```

- Place the following configuration into `config/deploy.js`

```javascript
ENV.cp = {
  destDir: '/srv/www/htdocs/'
};
```

- Run the pipeline

```bash
$ ember deploy
```

## Installation
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ember install ember-cli-deploy-cp
```

## ember-cli-deploy Hooks Implemented

For detailed information on what plugin hooks are and how they work, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][2].

- `configure`
- `upload`
- `didDeploy`

## Configuration Options

For detailed information on how configuration of plugins works, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][2].

### destDir

The root directory to which the contents of the [distDir](#distdir) will be copied to.

*Required*

### distDir

The root directory that will be used as source directory for cpr. By default, this option will use the `distDir` property of the deployment context.

*Default:* `context.distDir`

### didDeployMessage

A message that will be displayed after the distDir has been copied to destDir.

*Default:*

```javascript
if (context.revisionData.revisionKey) {
  return "Copied revision " + context.revisionData.revisionKey + ".";
}
```

### deleteFirst

Delete the [destDir](#destdir) with `rimraf` before the files are copied.

*Default:* `false`

### overwrite

If the destination exists, overwrite it.

*Default:* `true`

### confirm

After the copy operation, stat all the files and report errors if any are missing.

*Default:* `true`

### filePattern

`RegExp` or `function` to test each file against before copying.

*Default:* `undefined`  
*Example:*  
Because of the way ember-cli-deploy handles default config values internally, you need to provide a factory function as [filePattern](#filepattern) instead of the filter function directly.

```javascript
/*
 * Don't copy index.html 
 */
filePattern: function (/* context */) {
  return function(filePath) {
    var indexPattern = "index.html";
    return !(filePath.indexOf(indexPattern, filePath.length - indexPattern.length) !== -1);
  };
}
```

## Prerequisites

The following properties are expected to be present on the deployment `context` object:

- `distDir`                     (provided by [ember-cli-deploy-build][3])
- `revisionData.revisionKey`    (provided by [ember-cli-deploy-revision-data][4])

## Running Tests

- `npm test`

## TODO

Tests ... right?
